# Prime Video Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project is an interactive **Prime Video Dashboard** built using **Power BI**. The dashboard is designed to analyze streaming data, user engagement, content performance, and key metrics for the Prime Video platform, with visualizations that provide insights into user behavior and content trends.

## Features
- **Content Performance Analysis:** 
   - Displays insights into the top-performing movies and TV shows based on user engagement metrics such as total views, watch time, and user ratings. 
   - Visualizations include rankings of top content by genre, release date, and viewer demographics, helping analysts understand which content resonates most with specific audiences.
   - Provides a comparison of original Prime content versus licensed content, including viewership trends over time.

- **User Engagement Trends:** 
   - Track trends in user engagement, including watch time per user, active users over time, and average session duration.
   - Identify user preferences in terms of content genres, categories, and specific Prime Video features (e.g., subtitles, viewing in 4K).
   - Analyze binge-watching patterns, frequent rewatching of content, and seasonal viewership spikes.

- **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** 
   - KPIs track important metrics such as total hours streamed, active users, average ratings, and user growth over specific time periods.
   - Provides executives and decision-makers with high-level snapshots of platform health, audience engagement, and content success.
   - Additional KPIs may include subscriber growth, churn rates, and average revenue per user (ARPU), offering a detailed overview of both content and business performance.

- **Visualizations:** 
   - Includes various types of charts such as line charts for viewing trends over time, bar charts for comparing content performance, pie charts for market share analysis, and stacked charts to visualize complex relationships between variables.
   - Enables drill-down functionality, allowing users to break down aggregate data into finer details, such as specific geographic regions or time intervals.
   - Dynamic and interactive visuals allow users to adjust time periods, filter by genres, and customize the view to analyze data according to their needs.

- **Filter Options:** 
   - Interactive slicers and filters allow for custom data exploration, enabling users to drill down by multiple dimensions such as time period, content category, genre, region, and viewer type.
   - Cross-filtering capabilities allow users to see how changes in one area affect others, for example, how user engagement with a particular genre evolves over time or how a new release impacts overall watch time.
   - Responsive visualizations dynamically adjust as filters are applied, giving real-time insights into user preferences and content performance.

## Technologies Used
- **Power BI:** 
   - Power BI is the main tool used for building and designing the dashboard. Its capabilities for creating interactive visualizations make it ideal for the Prime Video dashboard, allowing users to gain actionable insights from large datasets.
   - Power BI's DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) language is employed to create complex calculations and aggregations, such as calculating rolling averages, growth rates, and custom KPIs.
   - Power BIâ€™s advanced data modeling features enable efficient data transformations, merging different datasets (e.g., viewership, content metadata, and demographic information) to create a unified and comprehensive analysis.

- **Excel/CSV Data:** 
   - Excel or CSV files were used as primary data sources, likely containing viewership data, content performance metrics, user demographics, and other related datasets.
   - These data files were cleaned, transformed, and loaded into Power BI for analysis. Using Excel as a base ensures the data can be easily updated and reloaded for future dashboard iterations.
   - In future expansions, this project can be connected to live data sources or integrated with databases for real-time updates.

- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** 
   - DAX is utilized extensively for calculations and measures within Power BI. Examples include custom time intelligence functions (e.g., year-over-year growth in viewership), content popularity ranking formulas, and metrics for user retention.
   - DAX allows for the creation of dynamic metrics that update based on user interactions, ensuring that visualizations reflect the most relevant and up-to-date data.
   - It helps create powerful aggregations and measures that summarize large amounts of data into digestible KPIs.
